/**
 * The `translucify` function is a utility designed to make a given color translucent by blending it with transparency.
 * By leveraging the CSS `color-mix` function, it combines the provided color with a transparent color, resulting in a translucent version of the original color.
 * This function is particularly useful for creating semi-transparent overlays, backgrounds, or other UI elements that require a touch of transparency.
 * To achieve the desired translucency, it's essential to provide a valid color string and a percentage value.
 *
 * @param color      The color value from the theme's color palette that needs to be made translucent.
 * @param percentage The percentage of translucency desired. It should be a value between 0 (fully transparent) and 100 (fully opaque).
 * @returns A string representing the translucent color.
 *
 * @throws Throws an error if the provided color is not of type string.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const translucentColor = translucify(theme.colors.primary, 50);
